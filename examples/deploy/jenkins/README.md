# Jenkins deployment with Stim

In this example we're deploying a Nginx container with Jenkins. This also uses Helm 3 and the stim version 1.3 that can run without the need of a second container in Jenkins. The goal is to have a simple Jenkinsfile with the logic in the deploy.sh so you can test locally.
To run this example, simply run `stim deploy` from this directory.
